/*
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.


Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  // First way i could go about this is itterate through both arrays, while this would give me a solution it would be O(n^2) time complexity
  // Ill start with it this way then see if i can get a more effecient solution
  // * this is the slow but working solution
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target && i !== j) {
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
  // * add in another faster solution below
};

const test = twoSum([3, 3], 6);
console.log(test);
